# GeminiCallCpp
A cpp program that asks the user for a prompt and then runs it through gemini to generate a response.

This program allows the integration of gemini into cpp.
Steps to run this program:
Make sure to configure vcpkg -> use these two commands in the same folder as CMakeList.txt
>vcpkg new --application

>vcpkg add port [name of package/library]
